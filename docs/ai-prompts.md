# AI Prompt History

This document contains both successful and failed AI prompt attempts for different days of the project.

## 📅 Day 1 – Project Setup (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)

### ✅ Successful Prompt
I am participating in a hackathon. Generate a React + Vite + TailwindCSS boilerplate for a hackathon project with:
Responsive navbar
Hero section with call-to-action
Features section
Footer
Follow mobile-first design.

**Notes:**
- This prompt produced a working mobile-first layout with all required sections.
- Navbar was later improved to be fully responsive with dark mode and animated hamburger menu.

### ❌ Failed Prompt Attempt
Give me HTML code for my hackathon website.

**Why It Failed:**
- Did not specify React or TailwindCSS.
- Output was plain HTML, not compatible with the chosen stack.
- Missing component structure needed for reusability.

## 📅 Day 2 – Orientation Detection

### ✅ Successful Prompt
Generate React code that detects device orientation (Portrait Up, Portrait Down, Landscape Left, Landscape Right)
using window.screen.orientation and deviceorientation events.
Map each orientation to a "mode" variable stored in state.
Ensure comments explain each step.
The code should work in React + Vite and handle both desktop and mobile browsers.

**Notes:**
- Worked successfully across mobile devices.
- Mode variable updates instantly when device orientation changes.
- Clean React hooks implementation with proper event listener cleanup.

### ❌ Failed Prompt Attempt

**Why It Failed:**

- Did not specify which browser APIs to use.
- No integration into React component state.
